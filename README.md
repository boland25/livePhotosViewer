# livePhotosViewer

Beginning of my work on the Live Photos Viewer.  It iterates through the device's camera roll, separates out all of the Live Photos, and plays them back at a slower speed. The sequence is from newest to oldest.
WIP: branch that has majority of the work is the rawAssetLivePhotos branch.  Eventually needs to be seaprated into differnet appropriate branches. master branch only has some initial work of understanding how the live photos are played using the PHLivePhoto class and its player.

all work is Swift 3.0
